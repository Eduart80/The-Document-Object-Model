Edit Posts:
Each displayed post should have an “Edit” button.
Clicking “Edit” should allow the user to modify the title and content of that specific post. This might involve populating the main form (or a modal form) with the existing post data.
After editing, the updated post should be reflected in the display.
Form validation should also apply during editing.

Delete Posts:
Each displayed post should have a “Delete” button.
Clicking “Delete” should remove the post from the display and from localStorage.
